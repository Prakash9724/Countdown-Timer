# Countdown Timer Project

## Overview
The Countdown Timer Project is a **Multiple Countdown Timer** application developed using **React** and **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform). This application allows users to create and manage multiple countdown timers that count down to specified dates and times. When a timer reaches zero, it triggers a sound alert and visual effects, enhancing the user experience.

## Features
- **Multiple Countdown Timers**: Users can create and manage several countdown timers simultaneously.
- **Sound Alerts**: A sound plays when the countdown reaches zero, providing an auditory notification.
- **Visual Effects**: Engaging animations are triggered when the timer ends, using GSAP for smooth transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy interaction and timer management.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components.
- **GSAP**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations that work across all major browsers.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling, enabling rapid UI development with a focus on customization.
